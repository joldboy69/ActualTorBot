# ActualTorBot
This is a program i made in python to bot your url shortener links (ex. adfly). 

To use the program, you will need a couple of things. 

1. Tor installed to your desktop. 
2. Python3 installed on your pc (yes this is for pc only at the moment). 

You will also need to modify the script a tiny bit by changing the tor directory path with your username. 

After that, you should be good to go. Just run the file in cmd with "python3 (path of your python file)". If you have any problems, feel free to submit an issue.
